      <img src="assets/images/skydive.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Will's Sky Dive in Key West" id="Pic">

    <p> I'm creative. Music is my first love. I've been Dj'ing my whole life - I was probably still in diapers as I was climbing stools to reach a turntable, playing music. In time I began to sing, play instruments, rap, produce, and write songs independently. </p>
    
    <br>

    <p>In the late 90's I got the name, <strong>Dj Will Power</strong>, while making mixed tapes for Underworld Radio - a late night underground Hip Hop show on FM radio, broadcasting out of Manhattan (New York). The show also had a brief run on XM Satellite in its begining phase, before it merged with Sirius. My professional experience as a DJ outside of this was mostly corporate events, private parties, and community events.</p>

    <br>

    <p><strong>Overpower Radio</strong> is the brand I'm developing. As an entity, like my musical style, I can't put the brand in a box. As it grows, I imagine it will operate as an entertainment blog, record label, production company, and an event coordinations/event promotions firm ..whatever works, as long as it's hot!!! ..and everyone has a great time.</p>
